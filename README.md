Experimental python wrapper for Cliquer - algorithm for finding max weighted clique in a graph:
https://users.aalto.fi/~pat/cliquer.html

Notice GPL licence inherited from Cliquer.

It is a ROS package, but there are no ROS dependencies so it should be easy to compile without ROS (see CMakeList.txt).

Examples are in src/clique_python_wrapper/test_find_clique.py
